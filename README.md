## William Day

I am a driven, confident, aspiring junior software developer and recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a coding bootcamp. I am very keen to get into the software development industry and embark on a creative and engaging career. I have spent the last 19 years on and off living in Spain, near Barcelona, and due to Covid related reasons, have moved to London to seek a new start.

My background has always been in hospitality, that's where I started, and I continued progressing to the point of owning my own pub and restaurant.

Despite only starting my career in development now, I am by no means a stranger to technology, having been building PCs, having a basic understanding of code, gaming, scripting and designing since a very young age.

| **[Dev's Full Stack Nightmare](https://github.com/Willinlondon/the-game)** | My final project at Makers, a web app game that involves an RPG style adventure through the nightmares of a junior developer. This project really tested our ability to work as a group and learn new things. Thorough planning and really hard work from all the team created something that we are very proud and passionate about, to the point of still wanting to continue working on it post Makers! | Node, Express, P5.js | https://sleepy-meadow-72878.herokuapp.com/ |
| **[Acebook](https://github.com/Willinlondon/acebook-rails-template-simple)** | The second engineering project at Makers, a first introduction to work in a large team, as well as using Ruby on Rails. The objective was to create a Facebook style post web app, which I feel we did fairly well. | Ruby, Rails | https://young-plains-56373.herokuapp.com/ |
| **[Makers BnB](https://github.com/Willinlondon/mk_bnb)** | The first engineering project at Makers, the objective was to create an airbnb style app. First time working in a group, and went really well. | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Active Record, Rspec | |

## Work Experience

**Shooters Sports & Grill** (late 2014 - late 2020), Salou, Spain  
_Owner_

- Managing the pub (expanded into a restaurant in 2018), as well as the external responsbilities that came with it. I personally would usually rotate among all of the roles in my pub as and when they were needed, these were: 
- Bar, this included managing all my drinks stock, counting tills, and ensuring the bar was a friendly lively environment.
- Kitchen, designing a menu and ensuring my busy small kitchen was up to the task of maintaining the quality, and doing some cooking myself.
- Floor, this was waitering for the restaurant side of the business, again ensuring all guests were looked after for.
- Security, often I would have to fill in or add to the door or internal security in the bar.
- Betting, the pub had a small betting booth addon, which was mainly focused on horse racing, but would take all sports bets.
- Tech Support, the pub boasted an impressive TV/streaming and sound system which was installed and maintained by myself.
- People, managing a team of approximately 12 staff during high season.
- Accounting, the majority of the company accounts and payrolls I managed internally.
