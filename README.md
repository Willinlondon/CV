## William Day

I am a confident, aspiring junior software developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp. I am very keen to get into the industry and embark on a passionate and engaging career. I have spent the last 19 years living in Spain, near Barcelona, and due to Covid related reasons, have moved to London to seek a new start.

My background has always been in hospitality, that's where I started, and I continued progressing to the point of owning my own pub and restaurant.

Despite only starting my career in development now, I am by no means a stranger to technology, having been building PCs, having a basic understanding of code, gaming, scripting and designing since a very young age.

| **[Dev's Full Stack Nightmare](https://github.com/Willinlondon/the-game)** | My final project at Makers, a web app game that involves an RPG style adventure through the nightmares of a junior developer. This project really tested our ability to work as a group and learn new things. Thorough planning and really hard work from all the team created something that we are very proud and passionate about, to the point of still wanting to continue working on it post Makers! | Node, Express, P5.js | https://sleepy-meadow-72878.herokuapp.com/ |
| **[Acebook](https://github.com/Willinlondon/acebook-rails-template-simple)** | The second engineering project at Makers, a first introduction to work in a large team, as well as using Ruby on Rails. The objective was to create a Facebook style post web app, which I feel we did fairly well. | Ruby, Rails | https://young-plains-56373.herokuapp.com/ |
| **[Makers BnB](https://github.com/Willinlondon/mk_bnb)** | The first engineering project at Makers, the objective was to create an airbnb style app. First time working in a group, and went really well. | Ruby, Sinatra, Capybara, Active Record, Rspec | |
